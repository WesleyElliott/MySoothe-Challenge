## :scroll: Description
This project is the result of the week 3 #AndroidDevChallenge of 2021. It's an attempt to implement
the design provided for the challenge as quick as possible - matching the specifications exactly.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I work better with provided designs instead of coming up with my own, so this challenge was a lot
easier to get working on quickly.
